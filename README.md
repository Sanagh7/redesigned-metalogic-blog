   cd redesigned-metalogic-blog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**

   npm run build
   ```

## üé® Design Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized following atomic design principles
- **Reusable Components**: Common UI elements are abstracted into reusable components
- **Smart/Dumb Components**: Clear separation of concerns between container and presentational components
- **Navigation Flow**: Implemented React Router with dedicated page components (HomePage, BlogPage, BlogDetailPage, NotFoundPage) for improved code organization and navigation experience

### Styling Strategy
- **Utility-First**: Using Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties for theme values
- **Dark Mode**: System-aware with manual toggle option
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with strategic breakpoints
- **Custom Typography**: Incorporated custom font (tapaikofontnaihamrofont) with adjusted letter spacing for unique brand identity
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Enhanced spacing, padding, and typography to create clear visual cues for content importance

### Animation Philosophy
- **Purpose-Driven**: Animations serve to enhance UX, not distract
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Respects reduced motion preferences
- **Subtle Feedback**: Added hover effects, transitions, and micro-interactions for user engagement
- **Contextual Movement**: Used parallax effects and mouse-position tracking in hero sections for depth

### Interactive Elements
- **User Engagement**: Implemented like, share, and bookmark functionality with visual feedback
- **Tooltips**: Added tooltips to provide contextual information for user actions
- **Clickable Features**: Made sidebar elements (Featured and Recent posts) interactive for improved navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Used hover states and animations to indicate interactive elements

### Navbar Design
- **Contextual Transparency**: Made Navbar transparent when at top of blog pages for seamless integration with hero sections
- **Scroll Awareness**: Added subtle background blur on scroll for improved readability
- **Brand Identity**: Updated company logo and adjusted "MetaLogic" name with proper spacing

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Focus Management**: Smart focus trapping in modals
- **Semantic HTML**: Meaningful HTML structure
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 compliant color schemes

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktops (1024px+)
- Large screens (1280px+)

## üîí Best Practices

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better maintainability
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and loading strategies
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags and semantic structure
