## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modern-blog-platform.git
   cd modern-blog-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üé® Design Decisions

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized following atomic design principles
- **Reusable Components**: Common UI elements are abstracted into reusable components
- **Smart/Dumb Components**: Clear separation of concerns between container and presentational components

### Styling Strategy
- **Utility-First**: Using Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties for theme values
- **Dark Mode**: System-aware with manual toggle option
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with strategic breakpoints

### Animation Philosophy
- **Purpose-Driven**: Animations serve to enhance UX, not distract
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Respects reduced motion preferences

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Focus Management**: Smart focus trapping in modals
- **Semantic HTML**: Meaningful HTML structure
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 compliant color schemes

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktops (1024px+)
- Large screens (1280px+)

## üîí Best Practices

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better maintainability
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and loading strategies
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags and semantic structure
